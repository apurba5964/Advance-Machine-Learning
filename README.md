This project is to develop a machine learning system that learns explainable features for a task domain while it is
learning to answer a variety of queries in that domain. It involves combining deep learning and probabilistic graphical models.
We are given M samples of an input, e.g., a photograph of a person, scanned images of a handwritten word written by a 
known writer. Our goal is to work with three different sets of features: human determined features, deep learning features,
explainable deep learning features. We use a discrimination task to compare the performance of each method.
